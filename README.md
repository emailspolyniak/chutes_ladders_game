# chutes_ladders_game
A simple Chutes and Ladders board game rethemed as "Holes and Jetpacks" that is programmed entirely in Java

The user plays against the computer by rolling dice and advancing up the game-board. If you land on a "hole" you will go back one space, if you land on a "jetpack" you will fly forward one space. The first player to reach the last space wins.
